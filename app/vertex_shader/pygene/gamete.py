"""
Implements gametes, which are the result of
splitting an organism's genome in two, and are
used in the organism's sexual reproduction

In our model, I don't use any concept of a chromosome.
In biology, during a cell's interphase, there are
no chromosomes as such - the genetic material
is scattered chaotically throughout the cell nucleus.

Chromosomes (from my limited knowledge of biologi)
are mostly just a device used in cell division.
Since division of cells in this model isn't
constrained by the physical structure of the cell,
we shouldn't need a construct of chromosomes.

Gametes support the python '+' operator for sexual
reproduction. Adding two gametes together produces
a whole new Organism.
